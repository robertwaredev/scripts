# Notes

## Premise

If we learn how to gather context more effectively, then we will inevitably become more creative both as artists and as people.

## Title Ideas

- The Most Important Tool for Creative People *(Secretly You Already Know This)*

## Main Points

Stick with the garden metaphor, use the abstract elements to make ideas concrete and easy to resonate with.

- Identify your workflow
- Identify conditions that serve the premise
- Group relevant *things* to create the "context"
- Leverage tools specialized in analyzing relevant attributes
- Observe and modify attributes to meet your conditions
- Identify where the success or failure in your context lies
- Continue iterating your context using what you learned

# Intro #review

If you’re a painter, a music producer, a writer, a YouTuber, or create *==things==* of any kind, then there's a high likelihood that you've struggled to consistently be ==*inspired to create things*== without inevitably getting burned out for long periods of time.

Weeks, months, even *years* of burnout can cause you to drop a creative pursuit entirely and attempt to become a backend web developer, ship out on a seasonal oil rigging job, or change lightbulbs at the top of communications towers.

I'm here to tell you that there is no magical, pre-existing aquifer of inspiration that will fill you up like a well. It's a ==nonsense== idea. How often you're inspired to create, and *how well* your ideas are fulfilled is reflective of how effectively your ==creative frameworks== support the scale and detail of your ideas.

---

==Lack of action== and excess knowledge usually kills inspiration instantly. You think you've achieved something by having learned all of this stuff, but when it comes time to use it for an idea you have, you either can't, or don't get the result you wanted. We often *overshoot* our practical experience and then get frustrated by the idea of having to go *back to the beginning* and learn through *actual experience*.

==Lack of knowledge== and the will to act, however, can directly inspire and propel you forward, creating a path for you to follow with new ideas to discover along the way, which you walk along with an eager focus, both for the sake of the journey and the destination. This is where pretty much all of us start as new creators.

---

Regardless of *when or where* inspiration strikes, the ==worst kind== of inspiration is the kind you have a ==*feeling*== of, rather than a ==*knowing*== of. You know the kind, the kind that's *grand* and *sweeping*, but will inevitably be lost in some restless purgatory of ==unfulfilled ideas==, abandoned by indecision, always a feeling, never concrete.

The ==*best* kind== of inspiration to be struck by is the ==*actionable* kind.== The kind you know *exactly* how to bring into reality, down to the fine details. Having the ability to easily build a game plan in your head that fulfills your creative needs lends you a certain magnitude of resolve that makes you virtually unstoppable.

---

As artists, we're constantly re-examining our creations at increasing levels of detail as the creation grows in complexity towards its final form. It is through varying ==*experiments*== within each of these aspects that inspiration can be born. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but it can sometimes take sticking with an idea you have for *extremely* long periods of time to really immerse yourself and prime your brain to think and create in a way that suits that idea, that story, that world, that universe.

==You can't force yourself to be inspired.== However, you *can* build a garden that produces fresh inspiration, fertilized with experience, watered with knowledge and emotion, strong enough to withstand the test of time. Truthfully, a garden *must* exist for such delicate seeds to grow, and the gardener must build the garden with care and see to its regular upkeep. It's the culmination of the gardener's dedication, the fertility of the soil, the plentiful supply of water, and a keen eye for weeds that need pulling which ultimately allow the seeds to grow and flourish.

So, let's learn how to build a garden.

# My Backstory #review

But first, if you’ve never seen my face before, my name is Robert. If you’re a new subscriber coming over from my podcast -

WHO IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS? HOW ARE YOU FINDING ME?

Bet ya didn’t know that I’m a real, live person, huh?

I started producing music in Reason 4 in 2010, which I used to produce most of my first album over the course of the next two years. By 2011, I was looking to try out new DAWs to see if I could enjoy a different songwriting experience.

I picked up FL Studio and I wrote like *one song* that made it onto that album I just mentioned. I dropped out of my senior year of high school to finish writing and mixing the album before it eventually dropped in October of 2012.

Feel free to check it out, but I warn you, it’s definitely a product of its time. After dropping that project, I was only more hungry to learn as much as I could. I picked up Ableton, which I’ve been using up until very recently as my primary creation environment. Bitwig's been where the fun is for me lately, but that's another video. Anyway, enough about me, back to the topic at hand here.

# It's Definitely Not Nothing #review

I can already see you sitting there like "That's an incredibly cool and heartwarming story bro, but how *exactly* do we build this garden? Like, what are the ==*actual mechanics*== you're gonna bring to the table to make this *goofy ass* metaphor work?"

> 🅰️ `CONTEXT`
> 🔊 *`Big orchestral impact sound`*

Alright, that's big reveal, hope you enjoyed the video, bye.

> 🎦 *`Walk off screen, fake YouTube recommended overlay + outro`*

For everyone still watching, it's about to get *real fucking textbook* up in here. I'm so, so sorry.

---

Meriam-Webster’s online dictionary defines context as a few different things *depending on the context*,

> 🅰️ *`Insert way overdone maniacal laughing that ends in violent coughing`*

but for the sake of this discussion, I’ve chosen the following definition:

> 🅰️ `“The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs”`

*Ooooh*, sounds *superfuckingboring,* so let's do what people do in video essays and extrapolate the ever loving *shit* out of this.

---

The first key word here is =="something"==. We're talking about ==*nouns*== here, folks. People, places, things, ideas, events.

Like my exes, where they are right now,

> 🎦 *`(looks over shoulder nervously)`*

the shit they left at my house, their *godawful* cooking, and, of course,

> 🎦 `Tight`

the day they all left when they *found out about each other*.

> 🎦 `Reset`

From here on out, we'll just refer to the *entire* realm of… *stuff* simply as *"things"*. Very fucking scientific.

> 🅰️ *`I think, therefore I am.`*

# Attribution Constitution #review

Next key word here is *==conditions==,* which can't *really* be mentioned without bringing up *==attributes==* as well. You'll see what I mean in a second here.

In English, a condition and and attribute are defined very similarly, with one definition hinging upon *==qualities==* and the other upon *==characteristics==*, so I'd like to set this up in a simple way, and illustrate how one of these relies upon on the other. Let's start with attributes.

---

## Attributes are…

> 🅰️ `"A quality or feature regarded as a characteristic or inherent part of someone or something."`

In other words, ==an aspect of *what* something is==. Assuming we want to change *what something is*, we could potentially ==*add or remove* attributes== to it, which will fundamentally re-define *what* it is.

For example, adding a planet into the background of a digital painting might fundamentally change *what genre* the painting is from fantasy to sci-fi, or adding another oscillator to your synth patch may fundamentally alter *what kind* of sound it is.

---

## Conditions are…

> 🅰️ `"The state of something with regard to its appearance, quality, or working order."`

In other words, ==an aspect of *how* something is==, and for our purposes, ==*how we want it to be*==. Assuming we want to change *how something is,* we can ==*modify* its existing attributes== to suit our needs.

For example, changing the colors in your digital painting could change *how* the overall mood is perceived, or turning up the distortion on your song's lead vocal could change *how sharply* it cuts through the other sounds in the mix, which people tend to like.

The differences between ==*what* and *how* can be subjective==, are often a matter of language, and often times both occupy the same exact space at the same time depending on how you frame it. I usually think of the "*what aspect*" as *being*, and the "*how aspect*" as *having*.

---

## Let me just gut punch you *real quick.*

The song that *you* enjoy the most has all sorts of varying aspects. The song could be *dynamic,* or *lush,* or *uplifting,* or *comforting,* or-

> 🔊 `DAMN SON, WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?.mp3`

Ooh, sorry about that, accidentally hit my sound board. I guess that still counts, technically. Anyway, songs can have all sorts of neat attributes that inform why we like or dislike them, or conditions that inform when and where it's appropriate to listen them.

You wouldn't play Nicki Minaj's 'Wet Ass Pussy' at your grandmother's funeral. Or maybe you would, I don't fucking know you or how you live your life, *so do what you want*, I guess.

In the case of people, we often ==confuse== our transient, *conditional* ==temper of mind== with our ==state of being==, which we then attribute to our self worth and the *very essence of what and how we are.* But rarely do we consider that others see us as *dynamic,* or *lush,* or *uplifting,* or *comforting,* or-

🔊 `DAMN SON, WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?.mp3`

> *`Big sigh`*

Yes, *that too.* You're a real piece of work, don't you forget it.

> 🎞️ *`Alex Jones saying "You god damn son of a bitch"`*

> 🅰️ *`I think I'm shitty, therefore I am shitty.`*

# Category 5 Brain Pain #review

There are ==five categories== that every attribute and condition you can imagine generally fits into. These are prerequisites, modifiers, qualifiers, states of mind, and states of being.

Yep, *unlimited* brain pain. *`(excited wiggle)`* You'll see.

To fix that, we need to be able to understand each one of these. Once we do, we can generalize our knowledge enough to understand nearly *anything*. I *promise* we'll get back to the art stuff soon, but we gotta go one step at a time, here. It'll be worth it.

---

## Let's start with ==prerequisites==.

> 🅰️ `“Something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else, such as an environmental requirement”`

For example, Scooby Doo needs his Scooby Snacks if he's gonna solve the mystery, right? Everyone knows this is just a simple fact of nature. *That* is a prerequisite.

---

## Then we have ==modifiers== and ==qualifiers==.

> 🅰️ `“A restricting or modifying factor, a qualification”`

Maybe Scooby has his snacks, but they're stale. In other words, *poor quality*. Maybe it's a *modified* flavor from the original, and someone making executive flavor decisions fucked up. Maybe the mystery never gets solved 'cause Scooby got a tummy ache due to shitty Scooby Snacks.

---

## Next is ==temper of mind==.

> 🅰️ `“Temper of mind”`

This is your *view of reality* as filtered by your personal biases, which affect your decisions to *take certain actions*. It’s a lifelong set of personal "umbrella" attributes and conditions that you use to determine which relationships to form. You adopt or internalize them over the course of your entire life by gathering context from relationships you’ve experienced previously.

Since we're doing the Scooby Doo thing, the *reason* that Scooby needs his snacks is that they're performance enhancing dru - I mean they put him in the *right state of mind*. He's gotta think *clearly* and not be afraid of whatever *spooky monster* comes next if he's gonna figure out how to make it out of my baseme - *solve mysteries with the gang*.

---

## This last one is where things get *pretty* wild.

> 🅰️ `“A state of being”`

> 🎞️ *`"You can tell that it’s an aspen tree because of the way that it is.”`*

Just in case you thought we were starting to build up some kind of sensible structure here, this one has to go and send us *way* off into the abstract. *Actually, though, ==this is what we want==.* The ability to ==manipulate and create *aspects*== out of *complete nonsense, thin air copium* is the singular most fundamental *aspect* of what *makes an artist an artist.*

#needsjoke #scoobydoo

In a way, the villains of the Scooby Doo series are a lot like us as artists. We have this abstract *vision* of what we believe should be brought into reality, and we're doing everything we know to do to get there. For our various villains, in part, their art is their persona, or their revenge plot, or the worldview which they're attempting to force everyone else into. All require some abstract *==vision==* of something that which does not yet exist.

---

# Sorry, Can't Relate #review

**The last key word here is *==interrelated==.*** Yes, we're still doing the same definition. It's been a minute, so let me put that back up on the screen for ya in case you forgot.

> 🅰️ `CONTEXT`
> 🅰️ `“The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs”`

Great. Onward!

A relation is defined as:

> 🅰️ `“An aspect or quality that connects two or more things or parts as being or belonging or working together or as being of the same kind”`

So what this means is that by ==knowing the attributes== of our *things*, we know ==*if* they're related, and *how* they're related==. By utilizing ==conditions==, we can determine whether or not that relationship is ==useful to us== for whatever it is that we're trying to accomplish.

---

For example, I believe that the earth is round-

> 🎞️ *`Neil Degrasse Tyson saying "oblong spheroid"`*

*Shut the FUCK UP, NEIL.*

Sorry about him, I can't seem to get rid of him.

I also know that my friend *"Timmy"* is a flat earther because it's been well expressed over many long, *incredibly* frustrating conversations. One of the many relationships between us is based on a certain *attribute* - which shape we believe the Earth is, and it is *not useful* because we *don't fucking agree.* Agreeing would be *useful* because I wouldn't have to fuckin' *hear it every time we hang out,* and would ultimately serve the desired goal of *deradicalizing Timmy.*

---

However, sometimes we deliberately look for certain relationships to be useless as a way to verify the need for other attributes, conditions, or relationships. Usefulness is what you make of it.

Like when you say water is wet and Timmy says that water *isn't* wet, and that it *wets instead.* This requires you to create the necessary conditions to prove to Timmy that water *is indeed wet*. So you both take a long drive to the nearest largeish body of water to perform a case study. Timmy's resulting silence, as he sinks to the bottom of the river, is, for all intents and purposes, an admission of his incorrectness, and thus a more *useful* relationship is formed. Of course *he* found out that water is wet… *and it wets.*

> Author's Note: That's so much more ominous than I realized it would be when I first wrote this.

# Gardening is Therapy #writing

Speaking of water,

> 🎦 `Super unnecessary zoom in of me chugging water and gasping for air`

> 🎦 `Wide`

Let's get back to building that garden! What was I saying before? Some pseudo-spiritual bullshit about experiential fertilizer, and… emotional water. Fuck me, *alright*.

> 🎦 `Wide, me face palming and shaking my head`

If you haven't realized yet, this is the part of the script writing process where I *really* just started taking shit up off of the wall. It's *very compelling shit*, if you ask me. *Revolutionary,* maybe. *Delicious,* even. I don't know, probably neither. It's in a bowl over there if you want some.

> 🎞️ `Gif of Reggie Watts`

---

If you know *anything* about gardening, you'll know that not all types of plants grow under the same kinds of *conditions*. Oho, you're probably seeing where this is going, yes? First we have to decide what we're growing.

> 🎦 `Wide`

"But Wonbert, I thought we were gwowing inspiwation in the gard-"

> 🎦 `Intense zoom in`

*Shut up, I know that, you fckn think I don't know that? I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU THAT.*

I'd argue that because every person is unique, the range of *things* we want to be *inspired to do* is nearly infinite. *Therefore,* your garden *can't* and *wiln't*

> 🎦 *`Close. Heavy, elongated blink. Short pause.`*

look exactly like mine. Don't worry, though the plants in our garden may look different, the process of building the garden remains the same.

# Cascading Contexts #writing

Now, context is the definition I mentioned before…

> 🅰️ `“The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs”`

but ==*"contexts"*== can also be thought of as the tangible frameworks or structures we use to *get the information we want.*

*Now* we're building with nails.

"Contexts" are assorted groups of *things*. How these things are grouped depends solely on what activity you're trying to engage in.

This might also be called a view, a workspace, or just a space by some people. They're used to examine *things* for relationships which may inform changes we want to make to other *things*, attributes, or relationships, or even create new *things* altogether.

We can consider any particular task or workflow we're trying to achieve, then use whatever constraints are available to us to observe the attributes of the relevant *things in action.*

---

Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

You’ll find that any context could be viewed as a *thing* in another, separate context of contexts. You can nest contexts inside of other contexts and add attributes, conditions, and relationships at different nest levels.

> Author's Note: ==*Elaborate on tiered levels of context…*==

It’s all a matter of how you need to view or process your *things*. Can it can reasonably be done? How prepared you are to wrestle with contexts potentially affecting contexts inside of them? If we can theoretically nest contexts of *things* inside of each other infinitely, how do we know where to create the first point of reference to build everything else from? How do we know when our contexts are doing their job, and when nesting them negatively impacts our work? One word:

---

# Use Your Insight Voice #writing

> 🅰️ `INSIGHT`

> 🅰️ `"The capacity to gain an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of a person or thing."`

To me, this is the least clearly defined aspect of this whole formula so far. I think to be reductionist, we can say that insight is intuitive understanding of how to engage with *ideas,* including the *idea* of who you believe a person is.

Regardless, context is needed. Either a lot of it, or a significant enough experience for something to to become intuitive enough to feel like insight. I'd make the argument, however, that context acquired through real, hard data is significantly more effective at producing results than context acquired through only inferring and not taking action.

> Author's Note: ==*Elaborate on contexts for contexts being the structure for producing insights…*==

> Author's Note: ==*Elaborate on the feedbacking nature of context & insight…*==

# No Ledge is Too High #writing

> 🅰️ `KNOWLEDGE`

> 🅰️ `"Facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject."`

> ==*Insert definition of knowledge…*==

> ==*Compounding insights leads to knowledge…*==

# Idea Machines #writing

## A Music Production Example

In music production, the rules of how *things* and attributes are presented and managed are not so structured, so we have to get a little more creative to set up areas in our DAW that serve as dedicated contexts for accomplishing certain workflows where a context isn't already built into the software to do that thing. Like one for managing our low frequency content, for example, or controlling all of our FX from one spot.

We want a relationship between our kick and our bass that improves the low-end frequencies of our song’s mix. The sounds of the kick and the bass are the *things* we're working with. We know that the kick and bass are related by several *attributes,* but one most importantly, that being that both the kick and the bass are *low frequency audio.* Our *condition* is that they should both positively contribute to the overall low frequencies of the song when playing at the same time. We’ll use this condition to guide the formation of the desired relationship between the kick and bass.

---

The goal, then, is to create a context that has the right tools for listening and analyzing *low frequency audio* to determine if the relationship between the kick and bass is benefitting the mix of the song.

To create the context in our DAW, we might group only our kick and bass tracks such that they sum together. Now they’re grouped or related not just in description, but in a tangible way we can actually work with. From here we can assess our *things* through several means.

First, we can use tools that help us understand the relationship between the kick and bass better, like an oscilloscope *(Shaperbox 3 is great)*, a spectrum analyzer, an EQ or filter to preview just the low frequencies, and a tool to solo the mono and stereo signals individually. We can go so far as creating useful presets for these tools, and building them into our project templates

Once our kick and sub sound good together, we can then use that relationship as some *thing* in yet another context.
