# Game Philosophy

## Monetization

- Buy to play only
- There should either be:
	- A single centralized in-game currency that has direct gameplay consequences (i.e. water in Caves of Qud)
	- No currency at all, and only player to player bartering
- Zero cash shop, micro currency, or microtransactions of any kind for any reason whatsoever.

## Gameplay

### Pillars

- Understanding the game should be extremely simple.
- There should never be time gated mechanics.

### World

#### Themes

- This is dark fantasy / sci-fi game, the goal is to feel oppressive.
- Civilization is extremely limited, most of the world is wilderness.

#### Principles

- The world itself should feel obscured by the limitations which specs offer solutions for, making every spec a fundamentally grounded and necessary part of the world, and combat, economy, and exploration a real limitation of specialization.
- The world is difficult and widely unfriendly. Highly specialized allies ease the journey, but do not stop the clever solo player from hacking their own path through the wilderness.
- Open world PvP creates natural distrust between players, while also creating an incentive to form unlikely parties based on the specialized abilities someone else can bring to the table.

### Specialization

#### Principles

- Specs should never exist for the sake of existing. If it cannot be grounded in consequential gameplay, it should not exist.
- There should never be a spec limitation preventing players from completing every spec. (i.e. Runescape)
- The variety of specs should be wide enough and consequential enough to encourage players to pick a few to begin with.
- Every spec should offer a complete "way of life" and include abilities that have real utility across combat, economy, and exploration.

### Gearing

- Understanding gearing should be extremely straight forward.
- Every piece of gear should have infinite replay value.
- Gear should always be a tradeoff you make for particular encounters, environments, or economic
- Gear should never have an "item level" associated with it.
- NO item rarity on gear. Gear should serve a specific gameplay function that pertains to aiding or resisting each combat spec.
- All gear should be modifiable to increase build variety rather than vertical power progression, such as increasing resistances or modifying ability mechanics to suit different combat playstyles.
