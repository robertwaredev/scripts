# Design Pillars

> For the record.

- The game should be extremely simple to understand, yet have a high mechanical skill ceiling.
- Rewards should always be based on how much risk you take.
- PvP cannot be turned off, go fuck yourself. PvP is *not* a game mode or a server type, it's a foundational design pillar upon which the world building and absolutely everything else rests.
- Game mechanics should be systematic and encourage socially driven PvP instead of defined game types, rules, or "win" states.
- World building and lore should be steeped and visually apparent, but a "main story quest" should not be required to understand the game or play it at a high level.

# Premise

> It's us versus the world.

- Light is the primary survival resource and currency in the game.
- The world itself is the primary antagonist of the game, and the social interactions that result from the world's difficult design is its primary story.

# The World Tree

- The World Tree is the planet-bound equivalent of a cosmic deity, uncaring and unfeeling, only creating and destroying. It sprouted from a cosmic seed that drifted for eons before making landfall, long before living memory.
- The World Tree is home to many denizens, which dwell on the surface of its vast branches, occasionally forming small settlements.
- The sun is only visible at the top-most branches of the World Tree.

# Fog

- The World Tree perpetually dusts the world with Fog, a storm of creative and destructive energy which drifts across the land, scouring and re-shaping everything it touches, acting as a primordial, chaotic force of manifestation. (Procedural Regeneration)
- Fog itself is the most important resource, and is gathered and condensed down to form Fogstones, which emit light that wards the effects of Fog, known as Foglight.
- Fog is made up of many "exclusion zone" style storms that roam the land, and is only survived by the most knowledgeable and well-prepared.
- Fog comes with the challenge of hallucinations, shifting environments, randomly mutated enemies, spontaneous player translocation, wormhole apparition, temporary quantum entanglement, evil twins from parallel universes, and much more.

# Light & Dark

> Wicked things this way come.

- Enemies, anomalies, and other disturbances emerge in the absence of light.
- Light sources exist in two forms: natural light, and Foglight.
- Natural light wards off darkness, and is produced by fire or bioluminescence.
- Foglight wards off darkness *and* protects against the effects of Fog, and is only produced by Fogstones.
- Natural lights and Foglights exist as a variety of worn and equipable items as well as buildable structures.

# Overworld

> A shifting, unpredictable realm.

- The Overworld is completely absent of sunlight, blocked out by the many branches of the World Tree.
- Enemies, anomalies, and other disturbances are constantly emerging from the darkness.
- Fog storms also roam the Overworld, destroying and creating new areas as it moves, as well as causing a variety of unpredictable effects.

# Underworld

> Don't get lost.

- The Underworld is a massive, subterranean cave network made up of the spaces left behind by the rotting roots of the World Tree. No sunlight reaches the Underworld.
- Enemies, anomalies, and other disturbances are constantly emerging from the darkness.
- Fog does not penetrate very deep into the Underworld, thus the Underworld remains a largely fixed gameplay space, save for passages leading to the Overworld.
- The Overworld has a multitude of passages to the Underworld which are created and destroyed in the Fog at random locations. These passages remain either until the Fog returns to scour them from the face of the map, or players protect them by building light structures that ward off the Fog.
- Civilization has attempted to rebuild here, free from the effects of Fog, but far from the resources necessary to keep darkness at bay.

# Fogstones & Foglight

> Order in chaos, and chaos in order.

- Fogstones produce Foglight, the only thing capable of negating the effects of Fog.
- Unlike natural light sources, Fogstones never fully expire, only dim to a minimum light level.
- Fogstones recharge by absorbing natural light sources, dimming them or even snuffing them out, with the only exception being the sun.
- Fogstones are naturally more radiant at a base level when in close proximity to Fog other Fogstones.

## Fogstones vs Fog

> Cosmic horrors beyond human comprehension.

- Fog cannot be dissipated by natural light like darkness can.
- The chaotic effects of Fog are only negated by Foglight.
- Everything which is unlit by Foglight will be scoured by Fog, which constantly roams the land and *changes* everything, procedurally destroying and creating areas completely anew.
- Everything which is lit by Foglight is left untouched by the effects of Fog, allowing players to create pockets of relative safety in which settlements, travel routes, resource farms, and more may be formed.
- As a Fog dweller, you'll have to roll without using Fogstones if you want the high rewards for your high risk, using only expendable light sources to guide you, if any light at all.

## Fogstones vs Overworld

- Due to the abundance of Fog on surface of the Overworld, Fogstones are naturally more radiant there, resonating positively with their unrefined state of matter, as if calling out for their home.
- On the Overworld, Fogstones can act as a navigational aid in finding or avoiding Fog when carried, a harbinger of encroaching Fog when built as structures such as street lamps or lighthouses, and importantly, an unfortunate beacon in the night for other players looking to profit on your misery.

## Fogstones vs Underworld

- In the Underworld, Fogstones have an increased radiance the deeper you go, and a reduced ability to absorb natural light to recharge.
- The Underworld

## Fogstones vs World Tree

- In the World Tree, Fogstones have a reduced radiance the higher you go, and an increased ability to absorb natural light to recharge.
- The World Tree is dark, difficult, and dangerous to traverse, but provides substantial payoff when you make it to the top branches and recharge your Fogstones.

# Dungeons

> Hold your ground.

- The goal of dungeons is not to provide some "endgame" in and of themselves, but rather serve as a type of resource node with the potential for long-term upgradability in mind.
- Dungeons are not "cleared" but rather continuously spawn enemies that must be held at bay, making dungeons more akin to a resource farm.
- Due to their persistent nature, dungeons double in function as strategic locations to contest.

# Resource Acquisition

> Resources exist in the following forms:

- Mineable
- Harvestable
- Gatherable
- Craftable

# Player Interactions

- This is a PvPvW game. The primary world design from the ground up is to encourage players to kill each other, and create long-term group based social dynamics that propagate freeform social PvP.
- PvP is not designed with rules or game-defined objectives in mind. PvP should sprout from the ambitions of players and the natural risk vs. reward gameplay that the world creates through its inherently difficult and transient nature.
- Open world PvP creates natural distrust between players, while also creating an incentive to form unlikely parties based on the specialized abilities someone else can bring to the table.
- Fogstones and other light structures can be destroyed by other players at any time, and are the primary means of establishing routes for travel and trade, creating settlements and safe houses between major locations, and locking randomly generated dungeons or resource nodes into the current world space to use for skilling or economy. This becomes the primary vehicle for PvP.
- The world is difficult and widely unfriendly. Highly specialized allies ease the journey, but do not stop the clever solo player from hacking their own path through the wilderness.

# Character Building

- NO gender or race locking due to classless progression.

# Gearing & Itemization

- Understanding gearing should be extremely straight forward.
- Every piece of gear should have infinite replay value.
- Gear should always be a tradeoff you make for particular encounters, environments, or economic
- Gear should never have an "item level" associated with it.
- NO item rarity on gear. Gear should serve a specific gameplay function that pertains to aiding or resisting each combat spec.
- All gear should be modifiable to increase build variety rather than vertical power progression, such as increasing resistances or modifying ability mechanics to suit different combat playstyles.

# Specialization

- Specs should never exist for the sake of existing. If it cannot be grounded in consequential gameplay, it should not exist.
- There should never be a spec limitation preventing players from completing every spec. (i.e. Runescape)
- The variety of specs should be wide enough and consequential enough to encourage players to pick a few to begin with.
- Every spec should offer a complete "way of life" and include abilities that have real utility across combat, economy, and exploration.
