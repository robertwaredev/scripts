# Inspirations

- Doom: Eternal / Postal: Brain Damaged
	- Immaculate Boomer Shooter Combat
	- High focus on twitch mobility
- OSRS
	- Simple Gearing
	- Classless Progression
	- Large Number of Skills
- Caves of Qud
	- Open Ended Goals
	- World Design & Aesthetic
- Dark Souls
	- Skill > Gear
	- Lore, Narrative Aesthetic
- 2B2T
	- The ambition of players fundamentally reshapes the world.
	- Player groups are formed socially based on trust, interests, and ambitions rather than through in-game "guild" mechanics.
- S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series
	- The world itself is your enemy
	- Exclusion zones & anomalies

# Monetization

- Buy to play only, paid expansions
- There should either be:
	- A single centralized in-game currency that has direct gameplay consequences (i.e. water in Caves of Qud)
	- No currency at all, and only player to player bartering
- Zero cash shop, micro currency, or microtransactions of any kind for any reason whatsoever.

# Design Pillars

> For the record.

- The game should be extremely simple to understand, yet have a high mechanical skill ceiling.
- World building and lore should be steeped and visually apparent, but a "main story quest" should not be required to understand the game or play it at a high level.

# Premise

> It's us versus the world.

- Light is the primary survival resource and currency in the game.
- The world itself is the primary antagonist of the game, and the social interactions that result from the world's difficult design is its primary story.

# The World Tree

> God is not a man.

- The World Tree is the land-bound equivalent to a cosmic deity, uncaring and unfeeling, only creating and destroying.
- The World Tree sprouted from a cosmic seed that drifted through the stars before making landfall, long before living memory.
- The World Tree perpetually emanates Fog, an unrefined force of creation and destruction which travels across the land, acting as a primordial, chaotic force of creation and destruction.

# Light & Dark

> A shifting, unpredictable realm.

- The overworld is absent of natural light, blocked out by the many branches of the World Tree.
- Enemies, anomalies, and other disturbances can only emerge in the absence of light.
- The radiance of light determines how effectively darkness is warded off.
- Light sources exist as a variety of worn and equipable items as well as buildable structures.
- Light exists in two forms: natural light, and Fogstone light, or Foglight.

# Fogstones

> Order in chaos.

- Fog itself is the most important resource, and is concentrated down to form Fogstones, the only light source capable of negating the effects of Fog. Fogstones are non-expendable items that have no resource cost.
- Fogstones invert their radiance in relation to their proximity to Fog.
- Fogstones are naturally more radiant on the overworld due to the abundance of Fog, resonating positively with their simpler state of matter, as if calling out for their home.
- Fogstones are naturally more anti-radiant the deeper into the underworld you go due to lack of Fog, even stealing light from nearby expendable light sources, thus expending them.
- On the overworld, Fogstones can act both as a navigational aid towards the Fog when carried, a harbinger of encroaching Fog when built as structures like street lamps or lighthouses, and importantly, an unfortunate beacon in the night for other players looking to profit on your misery.
- In the underworld, Fogstones act more as tools of combat, deception, and sabotage, providing utility in creating chaos rather than keeping it at bay.
- To truly take advantage of being a Fog dweller, you'll have to roll without Fogstones, using only expendable light sources to guide you, if any light at all.

# Fog Zones

> Cosmic horrors beyond human comprehension.

- Everything left in darkness will be scoured by Fog, which constantly roams the land and *changes* everything, procedurally destroying and creating areas completely anew.
- Everything which is lit by Foglight is left untouched by the effects of Fog, allowing players to create pockets of relative safety in which settlements, travel routes, resource farms, and more may be formed.
- Fog acts as pockets of roaming "exclusion zones" and is only survived by the most knowledgeable and well-prepared.
- Fog zones come with the challenge of hallucinations, shifting, environments, randomly mutated enemies, spontaneous player translocation, wormhole apparition, temporary quantum entanglement, and more. A true force of chaos.

# Underworld

> Don't get lost.

- The underworld is a MASSIVE subterranean cave network left behind by the rotted roots of the World Tree.
- The underworld is host to a largely abandoned cityscape which spans a large portion of the underworld, and has a multitude of entrances and exits that change with the passing of the Fog.
- Underworld entrances are created in the Fog at random locations, and remain either until the Fog returns to scour them from the face of the map, or players protect them by building light structures that ward off the Fog.
- Fog cannot penetrate very deep underground, thus the underworld remains a largely fixed gameplay space, save for areas near to and passages leading to the overworld.
- Due to the lack of Fog in the underworld, Fogstones are more anti-radiant the deeper underground you travel, increasing the ever-present threat posed by other players and enemies which live only in darkness.

# Dungeons

> Hold your ground.

- The goal of dungeons is not to provide some "endgame" in and of themselves, but rather serve as a type of resource node with the potential for long-term upgradability in mind.
- Dungeons are not "cleared" but rather continuously spawn enemies that must be held at bay, making dungeons more akin to a resource farm.
- Due to their persistent nature, dungeons double in function as strategic locations to contest.

# Resource Acquisition

# Player Interactions

- This is a PvPvW game. The primary world design from the ground up is to encourage players to kill each other, and create long-term group based social dynamics that propagate freeform social PvP.
- PvP is not designed with rules or game-defined objectives in mind. PvP should sprout from the ambitions of players and the natural risk vs. reward gameplay that the world creates through its inherently difficult and transient nature.
- Open world PvP creates natural distrust between players, while also creating an incentive to form unlikely parties based on the specialized abilities someone else can bring to the table.
- Fogstones and other light structures can be destroyed by other players at any time, and are the primary means of establishing routes for travel and trade, creating settlements and safe houses between major locations, and locking randomly generated dungeons or resource nodes into the current world space to use for skilling or economy. This becomes the primary vehicle for PvP.
- The world itself should feel obscured by the limitations which specs offer solutions for, making every spec a fundamentally grounded and necessary part of the world.
- Combat, economy, and exploration should be a real limitation of specialization.
- The world is difficult and widely unfriendly. Highly specialized allies ease the journey, but do not stop the clever solo player from hacking their own path through the wilderness.

# Character Building

- NO gender or race locking due to classless progression.

# Gearing & Itemization

- Understanding gearing should be extremely straight forward.
- Every piece of gear should have infinite replay value.
- Gear should always be a tradeoff you make for particular encounters, environments, or economic
- Gear should never have an "item level" associated with it.
- NO item rarity on gear. Gear should serve a specific gameplay function that pertains to aiding or resisting each combat spec.
- All gear should be modifiable to increase build variety rather than vertical power progression, such as increasing resistances or modifying ability mechanics to suit different combat playstyles.

# Specialization

- Specs should never exist for the sake of existing. If it cannot be grounded in consequential gameplay, it should not exist.
- There should never be a spec limitation preventing players from completing every spec. (i.e. Runescape)
- The variety of specs should be wide enough and consequential enough to encourage players to pick a few to begin with.
- Every spec should offer a complete "way of life" and include abilities that have real utility across combat, economy, and exploration.
